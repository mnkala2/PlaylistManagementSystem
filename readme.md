I used the below components to complete the solution

Python — a fantastic programming language used widely for all types of tasks

Flask-RESTful — an extension of the Flask library. Enables us to develop APIs quickly

SQLAlchemy — an ORM (Object Relational Mapper). Helps us to communicate with the database without writing SQL


Theoretical Questions
• List which principles you are following with this microservice
    The API is a restFul API
• List which design patterns you have used with this microservice and why
    I wanted to follow an MVC pattern, but the Flask was causing circular reference erros
• List where and why you used some characteristics of object oriented programming
    All my requests are sent  as object, object oriented design makes things easier to main and read and manipulated since we working with dedicated objects for each entity
